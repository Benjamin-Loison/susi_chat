# susi_chat

We implement a chat interface to communicate with a LLM. The following ways of communication are possible:

- using a command-line console within your Linux/Mac/Windows terminal
- using a command-line console within a Browser using Javascript to simulate the same environment that you can experience with the terminal
- using a voice interface: console inputs are done via speech recognition and responses are done either on a console or using text-to-speech

All of those options shall be possible either on a normal computer or using a Raspberry Pi which also should be able to show that the whole operation is done without internet connection.
